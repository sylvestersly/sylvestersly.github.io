<h3><u><b>Abstract</b></u></h3>
<p>This report seeks to summarise the final product on designing and building a responsive website about yourself that can be used to showcase such things as your CV. It could also be a portfolio of any interesting projects/coursework you have done, and a chance to record any personal and professional development.</p>

<hr>

<h3><u><b>Introduction</b></u></h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to summarise the contents of my websites, the positives and negative.  My primary aim for this project was to design a sophisticated portfolio. An American scientist quotes “Technology has a shadow side” (Weil, 1965).Therefore, I deem to explore its creative aspect in this project.</p>

<hr>

<h3><u><b>Inspiration for My Website</b></u></h3>
<p>Website development has been at the forefront of my studies for a while now. First and foremost, I inspire myself to do various things. However, in the creation of my website, I had various ideas from groups on LinkedIn. My biggest inspiration came from; 
<ul>
<li>Lynda</li>
<li>Udemy</li>
<li>CodeAcademy</li>
</ul>
 Both ‘Lynda’ and ‘Udemy’ provide online video courses. These organisations produce video tutorials taught by experts in the field. I learn by watching therefore most of my work are based off what I learn in these tutorials. Alot of time was invested in the CSS to ensure the design came out as expected.
</p>


<hr>

<h3><u><b>Accessibility of My Website</b></u></h3>
<p>I managed to remove certain barriers in my website which is why I included interactive elements. Like any website, it will have links, therefore it is important that the when the mouse hovers over a link the user detects that it’s a link. Hence, all the links in my website respond to user interaction by changing colours and switching to a hand.  </p> <br>
<p>My homepage features a slider which consist of three images. The slider has controls which users can press to move to the left or right. Furthermore, the slider responds to user interaction meaning when the mouse pointer is fixed on an image, the slide show stops. On the contrary, when the mouse pointer is away from the image it moves.</p> <br>
<p>All the videos used in my website are embedded videos from YouTube. These videos include a play, pause, full screen mode for the user. Again, most images used in my website feature alt tags to provides alternative information for an image. Choosing an alternative text for an image in case of poor connection or if a user uses a screen reader.</p>


<hr>

<h3><u><b>Usability in My Website</b></u></h3>
<p>Firstly, the website is responsive to user inputs. Thus, when the window of the website decreases, contents on the webpage shrink to allow smooth usage of the website, Also, it allows for mobile responsiveness which means it can be accessed from any mobile of different widths and heights and it will still be responsive. </p> <br>
<p>A few people tested my website for efficiency and satisfaction. According to three people the design of the website stands out, it’s a simple website with plain colours consisting of white grey and blue. The customised wrapper on each paragraph aims to take away boredom when someone is using the website. There were no broken links when they tested the website.</p> <br>
<p>Lastly, users are given all the information needed in any given tab they visit on the website. Feedback is very important in any website, that is why I used a preloader at the start of my homepage. The reason for the preloader was to prevent any waiting time and allow users remain focused.</p> <br>


<hr>

<h3><u><b>New Findings and New Knowledge</b></u></h3>
<p>Loading External plugins for the website was not a new knowledge as jQuery, bootstrap and others are external plugins. However, I found Themepunch Slider Revolution which is an innovative, responsive jQuery Slider Plugin that displays any media content in a nice way. The fact that it was fully responsive and intuitive to use on any device was great. I loaded the plugin into my script folder and then initialised the plugin in the body. Thereafter, I set the plugin with full screen parameters. </p> <br>
<p>Parallax has become one of the most used feature in today’s era. As intrigued as I am, I learnt how to do the parallax from w3schools. It wasn’t as cumbersome as I had imagines it to be. Nevertheless, choosing the right picture to fit the webpage took a bit of time. Considering that the parallax did not need a JavaScript code to run, executing this feature was simple.</p> <br>
<p>Media Queries. It allowed me to define set of rules for different media files in the same line of code. Previous knowledge in media queries were not as much as current. Stack overflow answered my question on changing the location of social media links on a website. </p> <br>



<hr>

<h3><u><b>What Went Well and Why</b></u></h3>
<p>The overall outline of the website went well since I used ‘Balsamiq mockups’ and OneNote to draw out my plan for the website making the design I had in mind was executed as planned. </p> <br>
<p>The use of an external plugin was very well Implemented on the homepage. Themepunch Slider had step by step guide on how to use the plugin to your preference. Every link on the website is fully working. I did not encounter too many bugs because I used a preloader to load all the big file size images.  </p> <br>


<hr>

<h3><u><b>What Could be Improved and Why</b></u></h3>
<p>The photographs on the photography page could have been improved using a modal. A modal would have been the best choice to use as it pops up with an enlarged version of the image. It could have been further developed into a slideshow to create a bit of interactivity on that webpage. As my JavaScript knowledge is improving, in the future, I hope to include a lot more of scripting on the website to enhance its usability.</p> <br>
<p>The Footer could have included the sitemap added to the bottom of the webpages. Having previously learnt how to draw out a sitemap, I hoped to include a site map to the footer. The reason for adding a sitemap would have improved accessibility element on the website.</p> <br>
<p>The button to my resume was linked directly to my video on YouTube. That is the reason why it did not have any navigation at the top to navigate back to the homepage. This could have been improved by changing the size of the video then adding some JavaScript code to Navigate back to the previous page. </p> <br>
